# J3tracer
I wanted to un-hitch the waveshare jetracer from the JetRacer image to be able to have some more functionality outside of the jupyter notebook.
The first few python packages you'll need to grab are the adafruit motorkit and servo kit packages. I believe you'll also need the Blinka library. The input being used is the ps3 style controller that is included with the waveshare jetracer. Outside of that, the JetPack distro from Nvidia should come with everything you need.
